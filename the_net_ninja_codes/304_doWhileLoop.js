// do while loop is just like while loop. however when out condition is not true the while loop will never be executed unlike that our doWhile loop will be executed at least once
// so our codes will be renderd regardless of if our condition is true or false

let i = 5;

do{
    console.log('the val of i is : ' + i )
} while(i < 5)
// the condition is not true but our code will be executed once. and then it will check the condition.
